[DevReach](https://devreach.com/) is one of the largest tech conferences in Eastern Europe with around 800 attendees this year. It is focused primarily on .NET and JavaScript. I had the pleasure to attend the conference as a speaker this time, talking about _Scalable Angular Applications_.  

I've been working with the framework for a while and wanted to prepare a session on the topic. It was the largest attendance I ever had on a talk so it was a challenging but also a very rewarding experience for me. Doing it on the 10'th year anniversary of the conference was also a special moment.

I also spoke the **DevStyleR** magazine (in Bulgarian) about Angular and my experience as a consultant. You can read the full article [here](https://devstyler.io/blog/2018/11/16/sreshta-sas-spetsialisti-ot-ukrajna-uk-i-balgariya/).
