Hi, I'm a software engineer based in Sofia, Bulgaria <img class="emoji" alt="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/12.1.4/72x72/1f1e7-1f1ec.png"> and I like to do some cool things with computers. Currently, I work as a solution architect at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">The World Bank Group</a>. Occasionaly, I <a href="/talks">speak</a> at confereces and conduct technical trainings. My general interests in software are: 

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Software Design & Architecture</li>
    <li>Web technologies</li>
    <li>Natural language processing</li>
</ul>

I'm also currently doing my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Sofia University. In this blog I write down my thoughts and experiences on technology and science.
