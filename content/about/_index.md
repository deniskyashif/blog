Hi, I'm a software developer based in Sofia, Bulgaria and I like to do some cool things with computers. I occasionaly <a href="/speaking">speak at confereces</a> and conduct technical trainings. My general interests in software are: 

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Web technologies</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science</li>
    <li>Natural language processing</li>
</ul>

I'm also currently doing my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Sofia University. In this blog I write down my thoughts and experiences on technology and science.
