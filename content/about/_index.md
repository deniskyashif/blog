Hi, I'm a software engineer based in Sofia, Bulgaria <img class="emoji" alt="ðŸ‡§ðŸ‡¬" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/v/12.1.4/72x72/1f1e7-1f1ec.png"> and I like to do some cool things with computers. This is where I collect my thoughts, because I believe that writing is the best way to improve your thinking.

Currently, I work as a solutions architect at <a href="https://www.worldbank.org/" target="_blank">The World Bank</a>. Prior to that, I led the engineering efforts on <a href="https://hub.coursedot.com/home" target="blank">Coursedot Instructor Hub</a>, one of the largest IT training marketplaces worldwide. 

Occasionaly, I <a href="/talks">speak</a> at confereces and conduct technical trainings. My general interests in software are: 

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Software Design & Architecture</li>
    <li>Web technologies</li>
    <li>Natural language processing</li>
</ul>

I'm also currently doing my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Sofia University. In this blog I write down my thoughts and experiences on technology and science.
