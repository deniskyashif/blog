Hi, I'm Denis. I'm a software developer based in Sofia, Bulgaria and work for <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/" target="_blank">Prevalent Inc.</a> where I do some cool things with computers. My general interests in software are: 

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Web technologies</li>
    <li>Theoretical computer science</li>
    <li>Natural language processing</li>
</ul>

I'm also currently doing my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Sofia University. In this blog I write down my thoughts and experiences on technology and science.
