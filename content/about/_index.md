Hi, I'm a software engineer based in Sofia, Bulgaria <img class="emoji" style="width: 20px; height: 20px" alt="" src="/images/country-flags/Bulgaria24x24.png"> and I like to do some cool things with computers. I love writing code, but I like deleting code even more. This place is where I collect my thoughts, as I believe that writing is the best way to improve one's thinking.

Occasionaly, I <a href="/talks">speak</a> at confereces and conduct technical trainings. My general interests in software are:

<ul class="interests">
    <li>Software Design & Architecture</li>
    <li>Distributed Systems</li>
    <li>Natural Language Processing</li>
</ul>
