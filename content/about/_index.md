Hi, I'm Denis. I'm a software developer based in Sofia, Bulgaria and work for <a href="https://www.prevalent.net/" target="_blank">Prevalent Inc.</a> where I do some cool things with computers. My general interests in software are: 

* Web technologies
* Theoretical computer science
* Natural language processing

I'm also currently doing my Master's degree in Computational Linguistics at Sofia University. In this blog I write down my thoughts and experiences on technology and science.
