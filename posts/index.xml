      <description>Last week I had the pleasure to speak at the annual EMEA PUG (Progress User Group) Challenge conference. Having my session proposal accepted I&amp;rsquo;ve been eagerly anticipating the event and as now it&amp;rsquo;s over, let me share my impressions with you.
The three-day event is sponsored by Progress and its partners and is aimed primarily at the Progress developer community. To my delight most of the sessions were technical. Needless to say the emphasis was on established technologies like OpenEdge and 4GL.</description>

      <description>KendoUI&amp;rsquo;s validator allows declaring rules and easily performing client-side validation for input and textarea elements. It offers great flexibility even when it comes to complex cases, when for example input fields are interconnected. Suppose we want to validate an element other than input or textarea, then calling validate() won&amp;rsquo;t be enough.
The Problem Let&amp;rsquo;s have a form consisting of a textarea and a grid.
&amp;lt;form id=&amp;#34;form&amp;#34;&amp;gt; &amp;lt;textarea name=&amp;#34;text&amp;#34;&amp;gt; Our world is a magical smoke screen &amp;lt;/textarea&amp;gt; &amp;lt;div id=&amp;#34;grid&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/div&amp;gt; &amp;lt;button id=&amp;#34;validate&amp;#34;&amp;gt;Validate&amp;lt;/button&amp;gt; &amp;lt;/form&amp;gt; We want to ensure the textarea&amp;rsquo;s value is not longer than 20 characters and the grid contains at least two rows.</description>

      <description>This year the .NET ecosystem welcomed DNX (.NET Execution Environment). Now developers are able to compile to and execute MSIL code on any operating system. This led to the increase of the framework&amp;rsquo;s popularity in places where Visual Studio isn&amp;rsquo;t available. Also the emergence of Roslyn, the new .NET compiler platform, which exposes all the compile stages via an API, allowed powerful code analysis tools to be easily written. This unleashed the development of some amazing projects like Omnisharp.</description>
